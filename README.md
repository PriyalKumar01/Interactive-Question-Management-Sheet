## 📜 Manifesto

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are the bedrock of software engineering interviews. However, tracking progress across hundreds of questions can be daunting.

**The Interactive Question Management Sheet** is built to solve this. It's not just a checklist; it's a **comprehensive learning environment**. Inspired by the Codolio platform, this tool empowers developers to:

- **Organize** their learning path hierarchically.
- **Track** their progress visually.
- **Revise** effectively with bookmarks and notes.
- **Focus** on what matters: solving problems.
